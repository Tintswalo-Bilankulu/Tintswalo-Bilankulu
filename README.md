# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! ðŸ‘‹

Hello there! I'm Tintswalo, a student who is excited about learning coding and exploring the vast world of technology. This is my GitHub profile where I'll be sharing my journey as I dive into the world of programming.

## About Me

I'm relatively new to coding, but I'm enthusiastic and eager to learn. Currently, I'm exploring various programming languages and trying to grasp fundamental concepts. My goal is to become proficient in Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Learning Journey

As a beginner, I'm taking small steps to build my coding skills. Here are some of the resources I'm using:

- Online tutorials
- Coding bootcamps
- Books on programming
- YouTube channels and online courses

## Goals

While I'm still at the beginning of my coding journey, I have some goals in mind:

- Learn the basics of programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, or any other language of interest.
- Build simple projects to apply what I've learned.
- Connect with fellow beginners and experienced developers to learn from their experiences and advice.
